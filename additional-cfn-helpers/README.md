# Additional Amazon Keyspaces AWS CloudFormation assets


### keyspaces-vpc-endpoint.yaml
- [Interface VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/vpc-endpoints.html) enable private communication between your virtual private cloud (VPC) running in Amazon VPC and Amazon Keyspaces. Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, which is an AWS service that enables private communication between VPCs and AWS services. AWS PrivateLink enables this by using an elastic network interface with private IPs in your VPC so that network traffic does not leave the Amazon network. Interface VPC endpoints don't require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. For more information, see Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and Interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink).
